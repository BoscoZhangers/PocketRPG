# PokemonRPG

### Preface
For my Grade 12 Computer Science class (ICS 4U1), I was tasked with building an RPG game that leverages basic data manipulation through I/O 
and supports a spontaneous stream of input from users to create a smooth, dynamic and immersive experience. Inspired by my interest in Pokémon,
I took to building my own simulated version of the famous Pokémon role-playing game where the user can traverse the world, gain experience, 
encounter pokémon, and face foes deployed by Team Rocket. 

The majority of the Pokémon-inspired graphical elements were hand-made using Pixilart.
