# 🎮 Pokémon RPG
*A Java-based console RPG inspired by the world of Pokémon*

---

## 📖 Preface
For my Grade 12 Computer Science class (**ICS4U1**), I was tasked with building an RPG game that leverages basic data manipulation through I/O and supports a spontaneous stream of input from users to create a smooth, dynamic, and immersive experience.  

Inspired by my interest in Pokémon, I took to building my own simulated version of the famous Pokémon role-playing game — where the player can traverse a world, gain experience, encounter Pokémon, and face foes deployed by none other than **Team Rocket**.  

Most of the Pokémon-inspired graphical elements were hand-made using **Pixilart**.
